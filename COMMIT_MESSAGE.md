# Comprehensive Invoice Generation System with Database Fixes

## Summary
- Implemented complete invoice generation system from quotes
- Fixed critical database trigger and schema issues
- Added packages functionality for better item management
- Resolved quote status update errors preventing invoice creation

## Database Fixes

### Invoice Number Generation (Critical Fix)
- **Problem**: `CAST(invoice_number AS INTEGER)` failed on formatted numbers like "INV-2024-0001"
- **Solution**: Created `extract_invoice_sequence()` function to properly parse sequence numbers from formatted invoice numbers
- **Files**: `supabase/migrations/20240925_fix_invoice_number_generation.sql`

### Enum Case Sensitivity Fix
- **Problem**: Triggers checked for 'Accepted' but database enum uses 'accepted'
- **Solution**: Updated all trigger functions to use lowercase enum values
- **Files**: `supabase/migrations/20240925_fix_enum_case_sensitivity.sql`

### Schema Alignment Fix
- **Problem**: Trigger functions expected columns that didn't exist in invoice_items table
- **Solution**: Updated triggers to match actual schema with composite primary key (invoice_id, item_id)
- **Files**: `supabase/migrations/20240925_fix_invoice_items_schema.sql`

## New Features

### Complete Invoice Generation System
- Automatic invoice generation when quote status changes to 'accepted'

## Technical Implementation

### Database Functions
- `generate_next_invoice_number()` - Handles formatted invoice number generation
- `extract_invoice_sequence()` - Parses sequence numbers from formatted strings
- `convert_quote_to_invoice(UUID)` - Manual conversion RPC function

### API Endpoints
