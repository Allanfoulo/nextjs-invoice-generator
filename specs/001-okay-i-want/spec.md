**Created**: 2025-01-08
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "okay i want to create an Service level agreement generation the userflow of it is in the @docs\APPLICATION_OVERVIEW.md ,and its something like this  ### 4. **SLA Generation Journey** Dashboard → SLAs → Select Quote → Choose Template → Customize Terms → Generate Agreement → Send for Signature → Track Compliance → Monitor Performance"

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-01-08

- **Q**: What data source should be used for SLA performance monitoring? → **A**: Application monitoring integration (uptime, response times)

### Session 2025-01-09

- **Q**: The specification contains conflicting requirements regarding template creation. Should the system use AI-generated templates maintained manually (one-time AI use) or completely manually created templates? → **A**: One-time AI generation of 4 package templates
- **Q**: How should the system handle quotes that contain multiple package types for SLA generation? → **A**: Generate separate SLAs for each package type
- **Q**: What specific variables should be extracted from quote data for template substitution? → **A**: User-selectable variables from predefined list
- **Q**: What performance targets should be set for template-based SLA generation? → **A**: Template selection <30s, PDF generation <10s
- **Q**: How should the system handle template editing and customization by users? → **A**: Layered approach: basic edits allowed, advanced changes require approval

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Enhanced SLA Template Management and Selection (Priority: P1)

Business users need access to an improved template library with industry-specific templates, better categorization, and enhanced template customization capabilities to streamline SLA creation for different client types and project complexities.

**Why this priority**: The current template system lacks industry diversity and customization options. Enhanced templates are foundational for creating relevant, professional SLAs that match specific business needs and client requirements.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by accessing the SLA generation interface, browsing available templates, creating custom templates, and verifying template preview functionality with proper quote data integration.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the user has selected a quote, **When** they access the template selection interface, **Then** they can browse templates categorized by package type (ecom_site, general_website, business_process_systems, marketing)
2. **Given** templates are displayed, **When** user selects a template, **Then** they see a comprehensive preview showing how quote data (client info, project scope, pricing) integrates with the template structure
3. **Given** no suitable template exists, **When** user chooses to create a custom template, **Then** they can build a new template with industry-specific clauses and performance metrics

---

### User Story 2 - Advanced SLA Customization with Clause Library (Priority: P1)

Users need comprehensive customization capabilities including access to a clause library, dynamic performance metric configuration, and industry-specific compliance requirements to create tailored SLAs that address unique client needs and regulatory requirements.

**Why this priority**: One-size-fits-all SLAs don't work for diverse client requirements. Advanced customization ensures SLAs are legally sound, compliant, and relevant to specific business relationships.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by customizing performance metrics, adding clauses from the library, modifying terms, and validating that all changes are properly reflected in the generated agreement with correct formatting.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a template is selected, **When** users access customization options, **Then** they can modify performance metrics (uptime, response time, resolution time) with visual slider controls and real-time validation
2. **Given** customization in progress, **When** users need specific legal language, **Then** they can search and add clauses from an industry-specific clause library with categories (service_delivery, liability, termination, compliance)
3. **Given** customization is complete, **When** users preview the agreement, **Then** all modifications are properly formatted and integrated into a professional document layout

---

### User Story 3 - Template Initialization and Smart Variable Suggestions (Priority: P1)

Users need one-time AI generation of 4 standardized package templates (Ecom Site, General Website, Business Process Systems, Marketing) with smart variable suggestions based on quote data analysis to establish a comprehensive template library for ongoing manual maintenance.

**Why this priority**: Creating professional, comprehensive templates from scratch is time-consuming and requires legal expertise. One-time AI generation establishes a solid foundation that can be manually maintained and customized for ongoing use.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by running the template initialization process and validating that all 4 package templates are generated with appropriate industry-specific clauses, performance metrics, and variable substitution capabilities.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the template initialization process is run, **When** AI generates the 4 package templates, **Then** each template contains industry-specific clauses, performance metrics, and legal frameworks appropriate for its package type
2. **Given** templates are generated, **When** users work with quote data, **Then** the system suggests variable mappings from quote fields to template variables with confidence scores
3. **Given** templates are established, **When** users create SLAs, **Then** they can customize and maintain templates manually without requiring further AI assistance

---

### User Story 4 - Multi-Channel Agreement Distribution and E-Signature Integration (Priority: P2)

Users need to send generated SLAs to clients through multiple channels (email, download, share links) and collect electronic signatures with proper tracking and verification to streamline the agreement finalization process.

**Why this priority**: The business value is only realized when agreements are signed. Efficient distribution and signature collection accelerates revenue recognition and client onboarding.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by generating an SLA, sending it through available channels, and verifying that signature tracking updates correctly throughout the process.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an SLA is generated, **When** user chooses distribution method, **Then** they can email the agreement directly, download PDF, or generate a secure sharing link
2. **Given** agreement is sent for signature, **When** client accesses the document, **Then** the system tracks views, signature status, and provides real-time updates to the sender
3. **Given** signature is collected, **When** process is complete, **Then** the signed agreement is stored with audit trail including timestamps, IP addresses, and verification details

---

### User Story 5 - Real-Time Compliance Monitoring and Performance Tracking (Priority: P2)

Users need to monitor ongoing compliance with SLA terms, track performance metrics against agreed targets, and receive automated alerts for potential breaches to maintain service quality and client satisfaction.

**Why this priority**: Post-signature monitoring transforms SLAs from static documents into active management tools that prevent service issues and maintain client relationships.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by setting up monitoring rules, simulating performance data, and verifying that compliance status updates correctly with appropriate alerts and breach notifications.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** signed SLAs exist, **When** viewing the compliance dashboard, **Then** users see real-time status for all agreements with color-coded compliance indicators
2. **Given** performance data is collected, **When** metrics fall below agreed thresholds, **Then** automated dashboard alerts are triggered with daily digest emails and manual escalation triggers with breach severity calculations and recommended actions
3. **Given** monitoring period is complete, **When** generating compliance reports, **Then** reports show historical performance, trend analysis, and breach incident details
