# Specification Quality Checklist: Enhanced SLA Generation System

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-01-08
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [ ] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [ ] Focused on user value and business needs
- [ ] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [ ] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [ ] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [ ] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [ ] Success criteria are measurable
- [ ] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [ ] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [ ] Edge cases are identified
- [ ] Scope is clearly bounded
- [ ] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [ ] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [ ] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [ ] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [ ] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Items marked incomplete require spec updates before `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`

## Validation Results

### Initial Validation Status: ✅ PASSED

**Content Quality Assessment**:
- ✅ Specification focuses on user value and business outcomes
- ✅ Written in non-technical language accessible to stakeholders
- ✅ All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) are complete
- ✅ No implementation details (frameworks, APIs, databases) included

**Requirement Completeness Assessment**:
- ✅ No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers found - all requirements are clearly defined
- ✅ All functional requirements are testable and unambiguous
- ✅ Success criteria are measurable and technology-agnostic
- ✅ Comprehensive acceptance scenarios provided for all user stories
- ✅ Edge cases identified covering data integrity, conflicts, and system failures
- ✅ Scope clearly bounded around SLA generation workflow
- ✅ Dependencies identified (quote data, templates, compliance frameworks)

**Feature Readiness Assessment**:
- ✅ All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria in user stories
- ✅ User scenarios cover complete workflow from template selection to compliance monitoring
- ✅ Success criteria align with user story outcomes and business value
- ✅ Specification maintains focus on "what" and "why" rather than "how"

**Quality Metrics**:
- User Stories: 5 comprehensive stories with clear priorities (P1/P2)
- Functional Requirements: 14 detailed requirements covering all aspects
- Success Criteria: 10 measurable outcomes with specific targets
- Acceptance Scenarios: 15 detailed scenarios covering all user journeys

**Ready for Next Phase**: ✅ Specification is complete and ready for `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`
