# Tasks: Enhanced Service Level Agreement (SLA) Generation System

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-okay-i-want/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md (user stories), data-model.md, research.md, contracts/api-contracts.md

- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- **Web app**: `app/` (Next.js), `components/`, `lib/` at repository root
- **Database**: `supabase/migrations/`

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-7)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 ‚Üí P2 ‚Üí P3 ‚Üí P4 ‚Üí P5)
- **Polish (Phase 8)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational - Integrates with US1 template system
- **User Story 3 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational - Integrates with US1/US2 templates
- **User Story 4 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational - Depends on US1-3 for agreement generation
- **User Story 5 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational - Depends on US1-4 for active agreements

### Within Each User Story

- Tests MUST be written and FAIL before implementation
- Services before components
- Core implementation before integration
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 2)
- Once Foundational phase completes, multiple P1 user stories can start in parallel
- All tests for a user story marked [P] can run in parallel
- Services within a story marked [P] can run in parallel
- Different user stories can be worked on in parallel by different team members

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1 (P1)

```bash
# Launch all tests for User Story 1 together:
Task: "Unit test for template filtering by package type in tests/sla/template-selector.test.tsx"
Task: "Integration test for quote-to-template data mapping in tests/integration/template-mapping.test.ts"
Task: "Contract test for template API endpoints in tests/sla/api/templates.test.ts"

# Launch all services for User Story 1 together:
Task: "Create SLA template management service in lib/sla/sla-service.ts"
Task: "Create template selector component in components/sla/template-selector.tsx"
Task: "Create variable preview component in components/sla/variable-preview.tsx"
```

---

## Parallel Example: All P1 Stories (Team of 3)

```bash
# After Foundational phase complete:
# Developer A: User Story 1 (Templates)
# Developer B: User Story 2 (Customization)
# Developer C: User Story 3 (AI Generation)

# All P1 stories can proceed in parallel since they only depend on Foundation
# Integration points defined but stories remain independently testable
```

---

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Verify tests fail before implementing
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Focus on template-based approach (not real-time AI integration)
- One-time AI use for initial templates, then manual maintenance
- Multi-package support generates separate SLAs for each package type
- Variable extraction from quote data with user-selectable options
- Performance targets: <30s template selection, <10s PDF generation
- Layered editing approach with approval workflow for advanced changes
